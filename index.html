            <p>A nonprofit organization is an object that operates to benefit society, not to generate profit.
			It's a legal creature that exists to fulfill a mission, such as charitable, educational,
			or religious purposes, rather than for financial gain. Nothing like businesses, nonprofits are not owned by 
			shareholders and any income they generate is invested back into the organization to support its mission. </p>
